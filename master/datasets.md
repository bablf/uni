A  study  done  by  [16]  explores  the  stylometric  likability  of  tweets  data.  They  used character n-grams as stylometric features and Naïve Bayes as the classifier. With a subset of 300-2000 tweets data of a  varying number of users, they  obtained 92% of accuracy ac hived  for unigram model while 100% achieved  through  the  bi-grams  model.  According  to  [17],  Naïve  Bayes  is  simple  yet  effective  method  in designing  a  text  classifier  with  high  accuracy  rate  and  fast  speed  given  a  large  number  of  training  data. On the other hand, [7] studied the use of  character n-grams using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the classifier to identify the author. Using 1000 tweets per user with 9000 users, the best character n-grams model they obtained was character unigram model with 76.1% of accuracy. While [18] considered verifying compromised  Twitter  account using  Author  Verification  by  using  a  range  of  50-100  words  per  user  with 10,000  users.  In  this  study,  they  used  profile-based  approach  where  they  implement  Simplified  Profile Intersection (SPI) method to verify the author. Using word n-grams (N=6) as their best stylometric features with 100 words from each user, they obtained an accuracy of 95.8%.
